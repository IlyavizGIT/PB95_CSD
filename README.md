## 📄 Main Info 📄
This save contains everthing unlocked and maxed out! (Except for 8-BIT systems, I *ACIDDENTALLY* picked the chip up for "Pyrus -" and it reseted the rank, but in the save it says that there's a 1000th level, also on every other 8-bit system there's ADPT (ADEPT) rank, not grand.) All Achivements Unlocked and World Records included (Possibly not)

## ❓ FAQ ❓
Q: Why are every collectibles aren't unlocked?

A: Because, this is my first time of editing the save, i do not know how do the save work in this game. Besides, i've been stugguling with the achivements name.

Q: Why is the name is "Administrator"?

A: Well, everybody will use the save (maybe no), using my own nickname (Phantom35) is like, IMPERSONATING. I actually wanted to make the username as "CHEATER" as a joke, but it's rude, so i stuck with "Administrator"
